        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>This mod makes the Icewind Dale expansion "Trials of the Luremaster" available to BG2:EE (v2.0 or later), Siege of Dragonspear and EET (Enhanced Edition Trilogy).</p>
        <p>The quest starts by talking to the halfling Hobart Stubbletoes, who can be found either in the Umar Hills Inn (SoA), Saradush Tavern (ToB), Amkethran Inn (ToB), in the southeastern area of the Coalition Camp (SoD) or Castle Dragonspear (SoD). In the course of the adventure you have the opportunity to explore a haunted castle, test your mettle in challenging combat and lift an ancient curse.</p>

      <section id="installation">
        <h2>Installation</h2>
        <p>This is a WeiDU mod, that means it is very easy to install. Simply unpack the downloaded archive into your game's installation directory (where you can find the file "chitin.key") and run <em>"setup-A7-TotLM-BG2EE.exe"</em> (Windows) or <em>"setup-A7-TotLM-BG2EE.command"</em> (macOS). Follow the instructions and you are ready to start.</p>
        <p>It is not required to start a new game after installing the mod. However, you must install it before entering either of the potential locations where you can meet Hobart for the first time.</p>
        <p>To uninstall, run <em>"setup-A7-TotLM-BG2EE.exe"</em> or <em>"setup-A7-TotLM-BG2EE.command"</em> again and follow the prompts.</p>
        <hr class="spacer" />
        <h3>Note for Siege of Dragonspear (SoD)</h3>
        <p>GOG and Steam both install the <em>Siege of Dragonspear</em> expansion in a way that is not moddable out of the box. You must install a mod called <a href="https://github.com/Argent77/A7-DlcMerger/releases/latest">DLC Merger</a> on your SoD installation before this or any other WeiDU-based mods can be installed.</p>
        <hr class="spacer" />
        <h3>Compatibility and mod order</h3>
        <p><strong>Tipun's IWD-in-EET</strong> is largely compatible with this mod. Some of the creature and scripting improvements will not be available, however. IWD-in-EET (IWD1_EET) must be installed before this mod.</p>
        <p><strong>Spell Revisions</strong> component <em>"Dispel Magic Fix"</em> interferes with the special dying behavior of revenants and trolls, making them unkillable by normal means. To work around this issue, install that component <em>before</em> the main component of this mod.</p>
        <p>Importing Icewind Dale spells will be skipped if the following mods are detected:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Sword Coast Statagems (SCS):</strong> Component <em>"Include arcane spells from IWD:EE"</em></li>
          <li><strong>IWDification:</strong> Component <em>"IWD arcane spell pack"</em></li>
        </ul>
        <!-- <p>It is recommended to install this mod after the above-mentioned mod components to minimize the risk of potential conflicts.</p> -->

      <!-- ================== C O M P O N E N T S ================== -->
      <section id="components">
        <h2>Mod Components</h2>
        <ol class="gappedlist">
          <li>
            <p><strong>Trials of the Luremaster for Baldur's Gate</strong> <em>(requires BG2:EE, SoD or EET patched to 2.0 or higher)</em></p>
            <p>This is the main component. It installs many new areas, creatures, items, spells and everything else needed to enjoy the adventure. (Recommended party strength: level 11 or higher.)</p>
            <p>The mod makes a number of slight changes to the adventure to bring it more in line with the Baldur's Gate universe. Spells and items that are only available in Icewind Dale and have little or no relevance in the adventure have been replaced by similar Baldur's Gate spells or items. Moreover, several events, scripts and creature animations have been expanded, improved or adapted to Baldur's Gate style.</p>
            <p>This component also makes a good number of unique Icewind Dale spells available to the player. They are added to various stores, creatures and containers.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Rebalance weapons and equipment</strong> <em>(requires the main component; not available for SoD)</em></p>
            <p>Many items in Icewind Dale are exceptionally powerful. Since the mod allows you to retrieve a good number of powerful weapons, armor and equipment, it may reduce the challenges of the rest of the game. This component replaces these items by less powerful variants.</p>

          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Reduce experience from monsters and quests</strong> <em>(requires the main component)</em></p>
            <p>The whole adventure allows you to earn about 300,000 to 400,000 XP which can be too much depending on when or where you start the quest. This component allows you to reduce the experience gained from killing monsters or granted by completing quest stages. You can choose from the following options:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Reduce by 25 percent</li>
              <li>Reduce by 50 percent</li>
              <li>Reduce by 75 percent <em>(Recommended if you start the quest in the Coalition Camp, Siege of Dragonspear campaign.)</em></li>
              <li>Grant no experience</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Allow to trade with Hobart before starting the adventure</strong> <em>(requires the main component)</em></p>
            <p>This component allows you to trade with Hobart's store even before you accept to join his adventure.</p>
            <p><strong>Attention:</strong> Some of the items for sale are quite powerful and may reduce the challenges of the rest of the game.</p>
