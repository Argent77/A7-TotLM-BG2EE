Level: 2
Range: Touch
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

This spell turns a creature invisible and makes it undetectable by normal vision or infravision. Items dropped or put down by the invisible creature become visible; items picked up disappear if tucked into the clothing or pouches worn by the creature. The spell remains in effect until it is magically broken or dispelled, until the recipient talks to or attacks any creature, or until 24 hours have passed. Thus, the invisible being can open doors, eat, climb stairs, etc., but if <PRO_HESHE> attacks or casts a spell, <PRO_HESHE> immediately becomes visible (although the invisibility enables <PRO_HIMHER> to attack first).~
@2972 = ~This armor was made by the dwarven smith Karador and an elven enchanter known as Elameth of Five Trees. During the time of cooperation between the Hand of the Seldarine and Dorn's Deep, many wondrous items were produced. This suit of armor was one of them. Exceptionally light and beautiful, the armor was originally worn by a female elven marshal in the Severed Hand, which is why the orcs didn't take it when they sacked the towers. The armor was later stolen from the Hand by Maiden Ilmadia.

"One of the first steps towards living in harmony with animals is learning to respect our ever-changing relationship with animals. Many people think of humans and demihumans as being superior to animals. However, as I've already stated, the criteria for 'superiority' is very subjective. For this reason, we must view our relationship with the animals of the wild on a personal and ever-changing basis. Give the creatures the respect they deserve, but always remember that predators are predators, no matter how much you respect their territory."~

Illep, a native of Myth Drannor, used the slender ebon wand to locate the snares and springblades he often encountered during numerous burglaries. Illep was well liked by most people, but a human warrior named Brammel took offense to Illep's foppish manner in a tavern one night. Despite Illep's skill with daggers, the lithe rogue could do little to recover from the axe wound to the upper chest and neck that Brammel dealt him. Brammel was arrested by town guards, and the wand was to be returned to Illep's family in Myth Drannor. The small caravan transporting the wand was sacked by human bandits and disappeared from history.

The target gets to save vs. Spell every round; if successful, the damage and berserk state are negated. This spell does not work against undead or extraplanar creatures that do not have blood (such as elementals).

Among the many weapons forged in the shadow of the Spine of World, several bear the mark of dwarven smiths. This magnificent battle axe is no exception. Its steel and balance are testament to the work of a caring weaponsmith, and the axe's edge is woven with enchantments that allow it to wound even supernatural creatures. Like many weapons of dwarven manufacture, the blade is light, allowing the user to swing the blade more quickly, and the never-dulling edge ensures that the cut is always a clean one. The dwarven runes along the haft spell out the word "Dorn's," no doubt a smith's mark indicating where the weapon was made.

Amidst the plains of the Eastern Shaar there lived a small human blacksmith, whose nearly dwarven height did not do his soul justice. Though a skilled weaponsmith, his true gift was his ability to whistle a heartfelt song that could cause a grown man to cry like a newborn. Only a reclusive mage shared and enjoyed time with the diminutive man, however, as others could only see his small size as a source of amusement. Deaf to the smith's song because of their own prejudices, their ridicule slowly grew into cruel torment which eventually persuaded the lighthearted man to leave his home forever. Before he left, he forged this weapon as a gift for his one friend, who also enchanted it during the making. Thus the blade sweetly whistles to its wielder when unsheathed. It was not long after that the mage also deserted the small town in disgust, taking the sword with him on his journeys.

The caster chooses a target, and the alicorn lance instantaneously fires at it, inflicting 3d6 points of piercing damage with a Save vs. Spell for half. Although the alicorn lance dissipates after it strikes, it always leaves a silvery radiance around the target that makes it easier to see and hit, giving it a -2 penalty to its Armor Class for 3 rounds.~

Duration: Special
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: 10-ft. radius
Saving Throw: Special

This spell infects the creature the caster touches with a rapidly spreading brown mold. If the infected creature fails a Save vs. Spell, the infection is severe and the creature takes magic damage as follows:

1st round: 4d6 damage
2nd round: 3d6 damage
3rd round: 2d6 damage
4th round: 1d6 damage

If the Saving Throw is successful, the damage is reduced as follows:

1st round: 2d6 damage
2nd round: 1d6 damage
3rd round: 1d6 damage

Each round after the first, the nearest creature within 10 ft. of the victim must make a Save vs. Spell or be infected by the mold at full strength. This process continues until the mold fails to infect a suitable host in time. Creatures already under the effects of the mold cannot contract it again. The brown mold quickly dies once the spell expires.~

Saving Throw: None

This spell conjures forth seven magical orbs that float in a ring above the caster's head. Each eye has a defensive and offensive ability, though once either one is used, the eye will lose its power. The powers of each eye are described below.

Eye of the Mind: This orb protects the caster against mental attacks such as charm, emotion, and fear. The eye can be expended as the 1st-level wizard spell Charm Person, bringing a humanoid creature under the caster's control for 1 turn (Save vs. Spell negates).

Eye of the Sword: This eye deflects the first physical damaging attack that strikes the caster. The eye may be expended as the 1st-level wizard spell Magic Missile, creating up to 5 missiles (one for every two levels of experience besides the first) that each strike a target for 1d4+1 magic damage.

Eye of the Mage: This eye absorbs one manifestation of fire, electrical, cold, or acid damage. The eye can also be expended as the 3rd-level wizard spell Lightning Bolt, dealing 1d6 electrical damage per level (capped at 10d6) to all creatures in its path.

Eye of Venom: This eye halts any one attack or effect that could poison the caster. The eye can also be expended as the 4th-level priest spell Poison, dealing 20 points of damage to one creature over a period of 20 seconds (Save vs. Poison negates).

Eye of the Spirit: This eye blocks one instant-death magic attack (Death Spell; Finger of Death; Power Word, Kill; Slay Living; Destruction). The wizard may instead choose to expend the eye's power as the 2nd-level wizard spell Ray of Enfeeblement, dropping a target's Strength to 5 (Save vs. Spell negates).

Eye of Fortitude: This eye blocks one stunning, deafness, blindness, or silence effect. It may alternatively be expended as the 4th-level wizard spell Shout, dealing 4d6 magic damage and deafening creatures within a 35-ft. cone (Save vs. Spell halves damage and negates deafness).

Eye of Stone: This eye shields the caster from a single petrification attack. It can also be used as the 3rd-level wizard spell Hold Person, rendering humanoids of man-size or smaller immobile for 1 round/level (Save vs. Spell negates).~
@21468 = ~Shout
(Invocation)

Level: 4
Range: 0
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 17-ft. cone with 15-deg. arc
Saving Throw: Special

Shout grants the wizard tremendous vocal powers, allowing <PRO_HIMHER> to emit an earsplitting roar from <PRO_HISHER> mouth in a cone-shaped area of effect. Any creature within this area is deafened for 9 rounds and suffers 4d6 points of magic damage. A successful Save vs. Spell negates the deafness and reduces the damage by half.~
@21469 = ~Suffocate
(Alteration)

Level: 7
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 4 rounds
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: 7-ft. radius
Saving Throw: Special

This spell draws the breath out of all creatures within the area of effect. Creatures that do not breathe are unaffected. Suffocating creatures suffer -4 to Armor Class, -4 to hit, -6 to Dexterity, one less attack per round, half movement rate, and take 4d8 points of magic damage per round. A successful Saving Throw negates all effects but 2d8 points of damage for one round. The effects begin to fade when the creature moves out of the area of effect, although it can take a round for a character to catch their second wind.~
@21472 = ~Whirlwind
(Invocation)

Level: 6
Sphere: Elemental Air
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: Special

This spell creates a small whirlwind within the caster's sight. The whirlwind will fly around randomly, harming friend and foe alike. The caster is immune to <PRO_HISHER> own spell, and elementals and other huge creatures are also unaffected. If a creature is caught in the path of the whirlwind, it takes 2d8 crushing damage, 2d8 slashing damage, and must make a Save vs. Breath Weapon or be stunned for 2 rounds. Creatures with 2 or fewer Hit Dice are automatically killed by this spell. A maximum of 8 targets can be affected, after which the whirlwind will dissipate.~
@21474 = ~Mist of Eldath
(Invocation)

Level: 7
Sphere: Elemental
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: 7-ft. radius
Saving Throw: None

This spell blankets the area of effect with a silver-blue mist—any creature within the mist will be cured of disease and poison and healed 25 Hit Points.~
@21478 = ~Cause Disease
(Necromancy)

Level: 3
Sphere: Healing
Range: Touch
Duration: 8 hours
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Neg.

This spell afflicts one creature the priest touches with a disease that saps the target of 5d4 points of Strength. A successful Save vs. Spell negates the effects. It cannot be cast by good-aligned characters.~

(Conjuration)

Level: 4
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 5-ft. radius
Saving Throw: Special

This spell conjures a sphere of glowing emerald acid that the caster can direct to strike any target within range. When it reaches its target, the sphere explodes and drenches the victim in potent acid. The victim suffers 1d4 points of acid damage per caster level, to a maximum of 12d4 points of damage. After the initial damage, the victim must save vs. Spell to avoid more damage. If unsuccessful, the victim continues to suffer acid damage in the following rounds, sustaining two less dice of damage each round. For example, an 8th-level wizard inflicts 8d4 damage with this spell on the first round, 6d4 on the second round, 4d4 on the third round, 2d4 on the fourth round, and the spell ends on the fifth round. Each round after the first, the victim is entitled to a Save vs. Spell to avoid further damage.

The vitriolic sphere also splashes acid in a 5-ft. radius around the primary target. Any creatures within the splash radius must save vs. Petrification/Polymorph or suffer a splash hit that inflicts 1d4 points of damage per every five levels of the caster. Splash hits do not cause continuing damage.~
@24246 = ~Mordenkainen's Force Missiles
(Invocation)

Level: 4
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 2-ft. radius
Saving Throw: Special

This spell creates a brilliant globe of magical energy that streaks forth from the caster's hand to unerringly strike its target, much like a Magic Missile spell. The wizard creates one missile at 7th level and an additional missile at every third level after 7th—in other words, two missiles at 10th level, three at 13th, four at 16th, and so on, to a maximum of seven missiles at 25th level. Each missile inflicts 2d4 points of damage to the target and then bursts in a 2-ft. radius concussive blast that inflicts 1 point of damage per level of the caster—for example, a 12th-level wizard could conjure two force missiles, each of which strikes for 2d4+12 points of magic damage. Creatures taking damage can attempt a Save vs. Spell to negate the concussion damage, but the impact of the missile itself allows no Saving Throw. The 1st-level wizard spell Shield will absorb the force missiles harmlessly, including the concussion damage.~
@24247 = ~Undead Ward
(Necromancy)

Level: 5
Sphere: Wards
Range: 0
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: 10-ft. radius
Saving Throw: None

This spell amplifies the influence a priest has over undead, though it is tied to the area surrounding the priest at the moment of its casting and does not move. Any undead creature entering the area of effect is affected as if turned by the priest that cast this spell. If the turning fails, the undead creature is immune to further turning attempts by the spell unless it leaves and reenters the area of effect.~
@24248 = ~Unfailing Endurance
(Necromancy)

Level: 4
Sphere: Necromantic
Range: Touch
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: 1 creature

@24250 = ~Cloud of Pestilence
(Alteration)

Level: 4
Sphere: Combat, Elemental Air
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 4 rounds
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: 12-ft. radius
Saving Throw: Neg.

This spell transforms the air in a 12-ft. radius into sickening, grayish mists. The caster and non-living creatures are immune to the effects of the cloud. For every round of exposure to the disease-ridden air, a creature must save vs. Breath or suffer 3 points of magic damage, blindness, and the loss of 3 points of Strength and Dexterity. The blindness and ability score penalties last 1 turn. Cloud of Pestilence can only be cast by evil-aligned characters.~
@24252 = ~Smashing Wave
(Invocation)

Level: 4
Sphere: Elemental Water
Range: 100 ft.
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: Special

This spell summons a 5-ft. wide wave of water that moves in the direction willed by the caster, striking all in its path with massive force. The wave deals 4d10 points of crushing damage; in addition, struck creatures may be either stunned (25% chance) or knocked unconscious (5% chance) for 2 rounds. If the creature struck makes a successful Save vs. Breath Weapon, the damage is reduced by half and the creature avoids being stunned or knocked unconscious.~
@24253 = ~Thorn Spray
(Alteration)

Level: 4
Sphere: Plant
Range: 30 ft.
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 17-ft. cone with 90-deg. arc
Saving Throw: 1/2

By means of this spell, the caster can cause a spray of barbs, spikes, thorns, and spines to spring forth from <PRO_HISHER> hand. The thorn spray covers a 17-ft.-long cone, inflicting 2d10 points of piercing damage to all creatures within the area of effect, or 1d10 points of damage if a Save vs. Death is successful.~
@24255 = ~Storm Shell

Level: 3
Sphere: Protection, Weather
Range: 0
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 6

(Alteration)

Level: 4
Sphere: Combat
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 2 turns
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

This spell works only on player characters or allied creatures. When cast, the target of this spell goes berserk, attacking the nearest creature until that creature is dead, then moving on to the next target. While under Blood Rage, the target is immune to charm, sleep, fear, hold, stunning, confusion, emotion, symbol spells, and related effects. In addition, the target gains +2 to hit, +3 to damage, +2 to Strength, +10 to maximum Hit Points, and +2 to <PRO_HISHER> movement rate. The spell has several disadvantages, however: The Hit Points of the target are masked for the duration of the spell, and the target cannot benefit from any effect that heals Hit Points. At the end of the spell's duration, the target becomes fatigued and <PRO_HISHER> Strength drops to 3 for 2 turns. Blood Rage cannot affect—and cannot be cast by—creatures of lawful alignment.~
@24812 = ~Lance of Disruption
(Invocation)

Level: 3

Kossuth appeared in a gigantic bonfire and did battle with the enormous supernatural beast. The god's avatar triumphed over the octopus, but the monster did manage to damage Kossuth's essence. The divine fire raced through the creature's body and lodged in one of the creature's eyes, quickly transforming it into a bizarre black sphere lit by the flame within.

Heaven above, Earth and Sea below
Sun's flight, Day turns to Night
Seasons change all that we know
Stones numbered five bring the gate alive
To home the passage will flow

From what I can garner from this, five gems are needed to activate the device. Each gem represents one of the five aspects of the gate: Heaven, Day, Earth, Sea, and Night. Only by placing the correct gem, at the appropriate point, will the portal open. 

Now, this all seems rather straightforward, and that is exactly what worries me. It is not the Master's way to be so forthcoming with information. It is my belief that the gems, whatever they may be, must be changed somehow. That would explain the line about the seasons. I must think about this some more..."~

@27100 = ~It was to be a simple device, capable of just reaching the surface above. With such a short range, the power requirements would be minimal. It took years, but we managed to do it. Unfortunately, it was our undoing...~
@27101 = ~Oh? What happened?~
@27102 = ~During our absence, humans had settled our lands and built the keep above. The portal opened into their inner sanctum. When my people stepped through, the humans mistook us for invaders. A terrible battle raged, and we were driven back through the portal.~
@27103 = ~I see. What happened next?~
@27104 = ~The humans pursued us as we fled and nearly decimated us. Satisfied that we were no longer a threat, they then dismantled the portal...~
@27105 = ~Wait. They dismantled the portal?~
@27106 = ~Yes, but hear me out... Years later, the master of the keep arrived. He studied the portal for some time and managed to reactivate it. Afterwards, he removed certain key components and scattered them throughout the caverns...~
@27108 = ~Do you know what these components are?~
@27109 = ~I'm sorry, but no. These events took place long before my lifetime. Perhaps a shaman of my people knows... but they would not reveal such secrets.~
@27110 = ~Where can I find a shaman?~
@27112 = ~Return from whence you came. Seek the room with the standing stones. It is there that they reside. Be warned, however: They will not welcome you as I have done.~
@27113 = ~One last question, Rikasha. Where can the portal be found?~
@27114 = ~Trials of the Luremaster

We asked Rikasha if he knew of a way out of the catacombs. He told us of a portal located within a temple on a lake here. The portal opens into the keep above, most likely the inner sanctum. Unfortunately, the Luremaster has disabled the portal by removing key components and scattering them throughout the catacombs. We need to discover what these components are. Rikasha believes a shaman of his people may possess this knowledge but would be unwilling to share it. The shamans reside in a room with standing stones. Perhaps we can find a clue to this puzzle there.~
@27115 = ~Continue along this passage and seek the temple of the lake. The portal lies within.~

@27136 = ~About the Luremaster? Well, I... I don't really know any more than you do. I just see him floating around the gate. Uh... other adventurers have told me his name. That's all.~
@27137 = ~Yeah, get on with it. At my age, you learn not to waste time with chit-chat.~
@27138 = ~This? It's my humble refuge from the sand and sun. I've collected a few bits and pieces of treasure from the ruins over time. Most of it's junk, but at least it occupies my time.~
@27139 = ~Eh... like you, I heard about it from someone else who came here. I've been trying to get at the treasure inside for quite a while now. I'm just one old halfling, though. Heh heh. What can I do against a ghost, hmm?~
@27140 = ~Sure, why not? It's not like any of this junk has sentimental value. Let me see what you have.~
@27141 = ~Heh heh. Amazing. You actually managed to get into the keep. You're the first. Maybe the Luremaster was right about you aft—oops. I mean... uh... heh heh.~
@27142 = ~Uh... I meant that... ugh. *gulp*~
@27143 = ~Please... please don't make me tell you. H-he can hear us. *gulp* He'll kill me if I tell you. Kill me!~
@27144 = ~Look, I'm stuck here, just like you. I'm sorry I wasn't entirely truthful when we met... I hope you don't die like all the others. Oh! I've said too much. Please don't ask me any more!~
@27146 = ~Well, since you put it that way... I know who the Luremaster is. I know all too well. I have been his guest for decades now. At least, I think it's been decades. Let me back up a bit and explain things.~
@27147 = ~I used to be an adventurer, just like you. Back then, I had a few less inches on my belly and a few more hairs on my foolish head. My companions wanted to explore the Battle of the Bones, south of Evereska. Well, I was interested in something else, a castle called Maluradek.~
@27148 = ~Yes, this very castle. It was as ruined then as it is now. The desert expanded, swallowing it up over a century ago. I got in easy enough. It was getting out that proved hard.~
@27149 = ~While I was searching for a way to get into the keep, the Luremaster appeared to me in all his ghostly glory. He spoke in his usual cryptic manner, presenting me with his "heroes challenge."~
@27150 = ~What did I do? I tucked tail and ran. Without looking back, I scaled down the outer wall from the east parapets. When I turned around to walk across the desert, I found myself back in the courtyard. No matter how I tried to climb, jump, or dig my way out of this damned castle, I wound up getting nowhere.~
@27151 = ~After days of hard work without food or water, I was seeing things. I must have passed out and started to dream. That's when I saw the Luremaster again. He asked me once again to take up his challenge. I told him that I had just come searching for some treasure. He had no pity for little old me.~
@27152 = ~He told me that only true heroes could leave the castle, and that, since I was obviously lacking in that department, I would have to serve him if I wanted to stay alive. He handed me a ring and told me it would transport me wherever I wanted for up to a day. By dawn, I would always appear back in the courtyard. In return, I was to find adventurers worthy of taking up his challenge.~
@27153 = ~Aye. And I would gladly give all the gold I've ever seen in my lifetime to have kept it just a dream. But when I woke, I found this damned ring on my finger. If I take it off, I'll die. I've been serving him ever since.~
@27154 = ~I'm sorry I was unpleasant to you when we met. I try not to get too attached to those I'm forced to bring here. You understand, right?~
@27155 = ~Over the years, there have been hundreds. You're the first to open the gates to the keep, though. *sigh* I hope you can lift the curse from this damned place.~
@27156 = ~Well, I'm no coward, but then again I'm no orc-wit either. I don't know how it is where you come from, but where I'm from, a halfling would have to have raisins in his braincase to traffic with spirits.~
@27157 = ~Hobart, what do you know about the strange ghost that lurks near the north gate?~
@27159 = ~Could I look at some of the things you've found? Would you be interested in trading?~
@27161 = ~How did you find this place, Hobart?~
@27162 = ~Sorry to bother you, Hobart. Farewell.~
@27164 = ~What do you know about him?~
@27166 = ~Farewell, Hobart.~
@27175 = ~Indeed. Are you interested in trading any of the goods you've collected?~
@27178 = ~Wait a moment... what did the Luremaster tell you about us?~
@27179 = ~Hobart, what are you hiding?~
@27180 = ~Listen to me, Hobart, you better start telling us what you know or we might have to get "rough."~
@27181 = ~I didn't realize... don't worry, we won't force you to tell us anything.~
@27182 = ~Can you at least give us some idea of what's going on here?~
@27183 = ~Hobart, I can command the forces of hell with a word. Do you think that the Luremaster scares me in the slightest? Tell... me... now.~
@27184 = ~Hobart, I can level towns with a word. Do you think that the Luremaster scares me in the slightest? Tell... me... now.~
@27185 = ~You will tell me now or you will die now. It's that simple.~
@27186 = ~I understand, Hobart. Can I see what you have to trade?~
@27187 = ~You little bastard. Tell me everything you know before I beat you to a pulp.~
@27188 = ~I've heard enough. Farewell, Hobart.~
@27189 = ~Go on.~
@27192 = ~This castle?~
@27200 = ~That's it?~
@27202 = ~What did he do?~
@27205 = ~I thought you said it was just a dream.~
@27206 = ~Trials of the Luremaster

We spoke with a strange spirit near the entrance to the castle keep. The spirit informed us that there is but one way to leave these ruins alive. Apparently, we must prove to him that we are worthy of bearing the mantle of heroes, whatever that means. The only clue he was willing to offer was a riddle.
 
North, east, south, and west,
In towers four the purgatives rest.
Feed them where the spirits nest,
Or forever here remain, our guest.
The sun rises, the earth warms,
Four men lie cold, yet no one mourns.
"Leave them be!" the mad lord warns,
And from my work their praise is shorn.

He told us to return once the task is complete, and we would be admitted inside the castle's keep.~
@27208 = ~Trials of the Luremaster

Upon entering the keep, we were visited once more by the haunting spirit called the Luremaster. It would seem that he has some tale he wants to share with us, but, rather than just tell us straight out, he wants us to discover it for ourselves. Again, the only clue he offered was a riddle.

To understand this shameful tale,
Through princely guards you must prevail.
'Neath unused arms and unstruck mail
Will you find the coffin's nail.
'Round and 'round the sun does fly,
And one man left below will die.
His crime? To make the peasant's eye
Reflect his lord's ignoble lie.~
@27209 = ~Trials of the Luremaster

We encountered the Luremaster in the dungeons beneath the keep. This time, his challenge was fairly straightforward: Find a way out of the dungeon, or give up and die. Perhaps his third riddle contains some clue that will help us discover a means of escape.

Your host was held unjustly while
The lord so full of wrath and guile
Demanded that this bard should style
A tale to make his people smile.
Suffer not your host's cruel doom;
Use your time to flee his room.
Shadowed dogs lurk in the gloom
And weave escape upon their loom.
If we chance to meet once more,
Your host will have a gift in store.
Defeat our shades in righteous war,
And we will trouble you no more.~
@27214 = ~Trials of the Luremaster

We managed to force a startling confession out of that halfling codger, Hobart. It seems that he's been in league with the Luremaster all along. He claims that he was forced into serving the ghost, and that he must continually bring adventurers to the castle or the riddling spirit will make a ghost out of him.~
@27215 = ~How many others have come through here?~
@27216 = ~Right. May I look at the goods you've collected?~
@27217 = ~Thank you for telling us. Farewell, Hobart.~
@27222 = ~So what did you do?~
@27225 = ~Salutations to the travelers. Welcome to Castle Maluradek. I am your adversary.~
@27226 = ~There is the matter of our disagreement.~
@27231 = ~At some point, you will come to believe that you should leave the castle. I will resist this course of action with all of my power.~
@27232 = ~You must enter the lure. You must prove that you are worthy of bearing the mantles of heroes. If you succeed, you will be allowed to leave. If not, you will die here.~
@27234 = ~My name is not important. As some say, it is the action, not the actor, who is of principle significance. Your actions in this lure will prove if you are actors of sufficient stature for the roles you are required to play.~
@27235 = ~There will be time enough for destruction in the days to come. In the meantime, enter the lure and take up my challenge. It is in your best interest, I assure you.~
@27236 = ~Some might call it such, but doing so would inject no levity into the matters at hand. Your goal is clear. It is up to you to attain it.~
@27237 = ~North, east, south, and west,
In towers four the purgatives rest.
Feed them where the spirits nest,
Or forever here remain, our guest.~
@27240 = ~The sun rises, the earth warms,
Four men lie cold, yet no one mourns.
"Leave them be!" the mad lord warns,
and from my work their praise is shorn.~
@27242 = ~Return here when you have completed the task at hand. Only then will you be admitted into these tragic halls.~
@27243 = ~You have proven to be more resourceful and fit for survival than any of the hundreds that have come before. You have demonstrated courage and wit where others cowered and yowled in frustration.~
@27244 = ~No. You may not leave until you have learned the story of what happened here.~
@27245 = ~It is important that you learn what happened here. It is important that I know you are capable of understanding the significance of why I am here.~
@27246 = ~I cannot be the narrator of my own tale. I spent my whole life telling other peoples' stories. The spirits that haunt this place are the ledger upon which my transactions were recorded.~
@27247 = ~There is no way out save by my grace. If you attempt to avoid your responsibility as heroes, not only will you fail, you will be no better than the man who penned this tragedy with his cowardice.~
@27248 = ~To understand this shameful tale,
Through princely guards you must prevail.
'Neath unused arms and unstruck mail,
Will you find the coffin's nail.~
@27249 = ~'Round and 'round the sun does fly,
And one man left below will die.
His crime? To make the peasant's eye
Reflect his lord's ignoble lie.~
@27250 = ~Now you stand where I once stood. Given enough time, perhaps you will sit where I sat, lay where I laid, and die where I died. However, unlike me, you will have the benefit of your hands and your voice in your final days.~
@27251 = ~There is no riddle here. There is simply a choice. You can stay in this dungeon until you die of starvation, or you can try to find a way out.~
@27252 = ~So we shall. While I cannot say that I am optimistic about your chances, I am less pessimistic than I have been about anyone else.~
@27253 = ~Your host was held unjustly while
The lord so full of wrath and guile
Demanded that this bard should style
A tale to make his people smile.~
@27254 = ~Suffer not your host's cruel doom,
Use your time to flee his room.
Shadowed dogs lurk in the gloom,
And weave escape upon their loom.~
@27255 = ~If we chance to meet once more,
Your host will have a gift in store.
Defeat our shades in righteous war,
And we shall haunt this place no more.~
@27256 = ~Time and time again, you have proven to exceed the castle's previous guests in both bravery and wits. Not only that, but you escaped death in the miserable dungeons where I perished so many decades ago.~
@27257 = ~Before you go, I would have you perform one final service for the residents of this castle.~
@27258 = ~Put our spirits to rest. Rid this castle of its specters in a battle worthy of a master poet's pen. After all I have put you through, it is only fitting that you now have a chance to strike back at those who have maligned you. We salute your bravery, heroes.~
@27259 = ~To arms!~
@27260 = ~We have no quarrel with you, spirit.~
@27261 = ~Does the adversary have a name?~
@27262 = ~Stand aside lest I destroy you.~
@27263 = ~I have no time to talk to your kind. Farewell.~
@27264 = ~Of what disagreement do you speak?~
@27265 = ~Farewell, spirit.~
@27266 = ~Why would you do such a thing?~
@27267 = ~Is this some kind of joke?~
@27268 = ~Very well. We accept your challenge.~
@27269 = ~I have no time to talk to your kind. Farewell.~
@27270 = ~What are you asking us to do?~
@27272 = ~I think not. I think it is in your best interest to stand aside.~
@27275 = ~Can you give us a hint as to what we need to do?~
@27277 = ~You'll pay for this, spirit.~
@27278 = ~Excuse me?~
@27279 = ~This is ridiculous.~
@27280 = ~Riddles? I traveled this whole distance for riddles?~
@27281 = ~That makes no sense.~
@27284 = ~Does this mean we can leave?~
@27285 = ~Let us leave.~
@27286 = ~Is there anything else you need from us?~
@27287 = ~Why are you doing this?~
@27288 = ~We entered your blasted lure. We put the spirits of the knights to rest. Now why won't you let us go?~
@27289 = ~Will you tell us what happened?~
@27290 = ~I'll find a way out, you'll see.~
@27291 = ~Why *are* you here?~
@27292 = ~I don't care about why you are here. I care about how I'm going to get out of here.~
@27293 = ~Where should we begin looking?~
@27294 = ~I'm tired of your games, riddlemaster.~
@27296 = ~I've heard enough from you. Farewell.~
@27297 = ~I have no intention of dying here. What is your next riddle, bard?~
@27298 = ~We'll see about that.~
@27299 = ~I've grown tired of your riddles.~
@27300 = ~What kind of a choice is that?~
@27302 = ~I have nothing more to say to you.~
@27305 = ~May we go now?~
@27306 = ~That's right, we did. Let us go.~
@27307 = ~What is that?~
@27308 = ~I'm not doing anything more for you. Let us go!~
@27309 = ~Who are you?~
@27310 = ~Do you know the way out of this miserable ruin? How did you get here? Tell me now or we'll kill you.~
@27311 = ~I am Crieck of Bane, and these are my associates. We are searching for a way out of this castle. If you do not help us, we will crush you into the desert sand. Do I make myself clear?~
@27312 = ~You've found trouble, weakling! Adran, Shelhai, kill them. If they don't have anything worthwhile on them, we can use their bodies to set off traps.~
@27313 = ~I see talking with you is pointless. Some people only understand how to work with others when their head is under a steel mace. I hope your goods are worth the trouble of killing you. Adran, Shelhai... kill them.~
@27314 = ~The end of our discussion is the end of your life. You are obviously useless. Adran, Shelhai, kill them. If they don't have anything worthwhile on them, we can use their bodies to set off traps.~
@27316 = ~I am <GABBER>. Well met, friend.~
@27317 = ~Who are *you*?~
@27318 = ~My name is not for you. Stand aside.~
@27319 = ~No, I don't know the way out. We came here with Hobart.~
@27320 = ~I'm not telling you anything. You would be wise to get out of my way.~
@27321 = ~Still your tongue, or we'll still it for you.~
@27322 = ~Look, friend, we don't want any trouble.~
@27323 = ~As clear as the waters on the Unicorn Run. That doesn't mean I'm going to help you, though.~
@27324 = ~I'm done talking to you.~
@27325 = ~What? More shades to haunt Harald's failing eyes? Who goes there? Am I talking aloud? Am I awake? This is not a dream. Is this a dream?~
@27326 = ~I am just a man. When I had use for a name, others called me Harald. I was a holy warrior, you know. I was a paladin of Tyr. Once.~
@27327 = ~In my heart, I knew it was for money. That's why we came, Dabath. I knew, I knew. I tricked myself into believing it was for some noble purpose. I don't know which was greater, the lie to the church or the lies I told to myself.~
@27328 = ~Poor Dabath. I think he was my friend. Did I have any friends? He was my comrade. I know that. He died in one of the traps. I saw him bleeding there with the others and... I ran. I was afraid.~
@27329 = ~Do you know what it's like to be afraid? I thought that Tyr had left me. He didn't. I left him. Now, there is no god left in me. There is no god in this desert. It's all dead. Do you understand?~
@27330 = ~Good, good. I don't want to see it coming, you see. Just make it quick and clean, when I'm not expecting it. Thank you, Dabath.~
@27331 = ~THEN WHAT GOOD ARE YOU?! WHAT GOOD ARE YOU?! Why can't you just put on a mask and pretend for a moment?! Just lie to me the way I lied to myself! Why can't you do that?! *sob* WHY?! *sob*~
@27332 = ~I've lost my way. I'm lost in the desert. I wasn't always lost, you know. Once, I was a holy warrior. A paladin. I served Tyr. Who brings justice in the desert? I have had dead men's food and water for ages, but not a sip of justice.~
@27333 = ~Yes, yes... they are. I told myself it wasn't for the money. And really, it wasn't. I was greedy for fame, for glory. I wanted to be *spectacular* in my humility. What a fool I was then. Too bad the currency for my payment was minted in my comrades. Like Dabath.~
@27334 = ~You must be the water bearer, and I the one who drinks from your pitcher. Is it clear yet? I don't care if it's only in a dream. Just let me die. Please.~
@27335 = ~That is the wrong pitcher. The one I seek contains water as red as wine.~
@27336 = ~Well met, old one. I am <GABBER>. Who are you?~
@27337 = ~What seems to be the problem?~
@27338 = ~Farewell, Harald.~
@27341 = ~Who is Dabath?~
@27342 = ~Aren't paladins supposed to avoid greed?~
@27344 = ~Yes, I understand.~
@27345 = ~No, I don't understand.~
@27347 = ~You want me to kill you? I'm no executioner.~
@27349 = ~Uh, okay Harald. Farewell.~
@27359 = ~What happened to you?~

@27361 = ~Right. Farewell, Harald.~
@27362 = ~Cloak of Scintillating Colors~
@27363 = ~The origins of this cloak have been lost in the mists of time. However, for some time it was in the possession of Drosus, a mage of no small power from Waterdeep. Drosus fell afoul of an unusually large group of winter wolves on a solo expedition into the Spine of the World mountains having been forced to don a heavier cloak to keep out of the cold... 

At first glance this cloak appears to be blinding white in color. However, it is in fact a composite of thousands of colors, which dance and play in any available light source. This barrage of scintillating colors tends to distract and partially blind anyone staring directly at the wearer.

The bow was then given to an assassin for hire, Teraven Docen, who was quite successful in bringing down many of the ice-maiden's children over a three-year period of bounty hunting. The assassin met his match, however, when attempting to ambush a traveling gnome who carried a wand of fireballs. Only the bow survived the repeated immolations.

@27366 = ~Chautog's Thinker~
@27367 = ~This rare helm owes its creation to an orcish warrior mage. 

Chautog's unusual story began when his village was destroyed in the crossfire from a battle between two rival wizard factions. One of the victors, the enchanter Shandellon, felt a twinge of guilt when he surveyed the collateral damage and as atonement took in the village's only survivor and raised the young orc as his son. 

Under Shandellon's tutelage, Chautog proved adept at magic despite his crude heritage. However, Chautog constantly found himself working harder than Shandellon's human apprentices and producing inferior results. As jealousy overtook him, Chautog locked himself in his room and toiled day and night on an enchanted item that would allow him to compete with his peers.

The fruit of his labor, though fairly unattractive, was an amazing helmet that would dramatically increase the wearer's intelligence. Chautog immediately donned his prize. However, he quickly discovered that ignorance can be a boon to one whose existence is as pathetic as that of a jealous orc. Shandellon found the charred remains of his adopted son, still wearing the now coal-black helmet, next to a note bearing one simple sentence: "Some things are best left undone."

When worn, Chautog's Thinker confers an Armor Class bonus of 1 and raises the wearer's intelligence by 2. However, the helm is unappealing to look at and quite heavy, being of orc design. Thus, charisma is lowered by 2 and a strength of 17 is required to comfortably wear the helm.

All manner of bandits, murderers, rapists, and other worthies were left dangling from its knotty limbs; and all to the delight of the gravedigger Mordigan. For Mordigan, a secret practitioner of the necromantic arts, saw ample opportunity in which to ply his trade. Interring the remains of the evil men within close proximity of the tree, Mordigan called upon the dark powers of the negative material to perform a baleful act upon the black willow. It was given a sort of semi-sentience, and the ability to feed upon the remains of those who had so recently swung from its branches. Black roots descended into rotting flesh; and alarmingly enough, the tortured visages of the slain began to appear in the twisted knots of the black willow's bole before its burning. But, to the surprise of the villagers, the potently ensorcelled staff carved by the hands of the evil Mordigan did indeed prove to be their undoing. And thus did the hanged men of Dead Man's Tree have their revenge.

On the coastline of the Sea of Moving Ice, there dwelled Prashnak, an abjurer—and a stubborn one at that. Apparently Prashnak was having a great deal of difficulty fending off a relentless scourge of trolls, who no doubt were interested in nothing more than his dug out, well stationed bower. Prashnak used storms of acid to keep the trolls at bay. However the young mage was tiring of the constant attacks, and the trolls were becoming bolder.

After several months of studying the various effects of wilting magic, elemental summoning, and magical methods of frosting, Prashnak was finally ready to try his experiment. After summoning a water elemental, Prashnak evaporated choice bodily components and then froze the hapless creature. This lead to the creation of truly horrific sculptures of ice. The trolls, as simple as they are, took extreme offense to these totems and reportedly fled the area. The experiment a gleaming success, the exultant Prashnak continues his woeful studies to this day. What manner of thief took hold of the bracers is unknown, but they have been missing for several years.

@27373 = ~Skullflail, or "The Flail of Teeth" as it is more commonly known, was constructed in 1035 DR for the barbarian warlord Wychgar. During a battle in the northern wastes which became known as Hallowed Pass, Wychgar lost his three brothers to the orc army led by Kraag the Mighty. Wychgar was distraught and during the night he wandered the battlefield looking for their bodies to take away for proper burial. He stumbled across them and was visited by the brothers' spirits who were trapped between the land of the living and the land of the dead. Unable to help them leave he had their souls stored in the flail with the help of a shaman.

The three heads of the flail are his brother's skulls, which are attached to the shaft by silver chains. The three skull-heads grin maniacally at their new life. When the flail is used in combat the three heads bite the target, tearing and rending flesh.

Memnon used the weapon very little, deigning to give it to a powerful lieutenant. When Memnon and Calim fell to elven high magic, their servants fled or were driven back to their home planes. It is believed that the Wind of Heaven found its way back into the hands of the djinn after the epic war.

Despite this, most theologians know very little about what happened to the unfortunate dying god whom the malefic trio consumed prior to their encounter with Jergal. What is known is that a small portion of the dead god's essence found its way to the Astral Plane, where it coalesced into one of the smallest islands of slain divinity. This small hunk of rock and odd ore was captured hundreds of years later by an enchanter named Merdros. Merdros's duergar servants created this blade for the wizard's most powerful warrior ally. Owners of the blade claimed that they could feel the dead god's final memories flowing through the weapon when they held it.

...only Watchknight Giles was not 
deterred by Aehirglass's sudden charge. 
Determined to shield Lord Maluradek's flight,
he refused to give ground to the storming
beast. And so it was by keeping his wits 
about him, his keen eye saw another way the
dragon might be undone. 

With the sun high above him and mace
firmly in hand, he let the dragon's talons
rake at his tabard, exposing his shining 
breastplate to the sun. Not a drop of blood
was shed, such was the skill he had timed
the swift dragon's speed.

He turned so that the breast of his 
gleaming armor caught the sun
and sent spears of the sun's rays
into the dragon's eyes. Unprepared 
for the radiance, the lids of the beast
snapped closed, and his charge faltered,
the beast blinded!

And so with his Wits about him, Giles 
brought his great mace down upon
Aehirglass's skull, drawing the first blood of
the day...~

...and the third of the four Watchknights fell, 
his spear planted in the ground against
Aehirglass's charge. The dragon's wings 
were as shreds, its wounds were great, 
but the dragon knew the day was his.

It turned upon the last of the warriors, 
Erris, the fourth Watchknight. There were
no other warriors to be seen, for Lord
Maluradek had still not taken the field.
Erris rushed in to strike but was snatched
up in the dragon's grip, and the creature's
head reared back to bite the Watchknight's
head from his body.

Yet Aehirglass had not counted on Erris's
strength. Struggling against the dragon's
grip, the Watchknight cleaved through its 
neck with his mighty axe, the blade diving
into the gap in the scales of the dragon's throat
left by numerous spear and sword wounds. 

With a mighty cry to Helm, he made two blows
of one! He reversed his swing to catch the neck
from the other side as the talons crushed at him, 
and there was a twin cracking like thunder, 
as the knight's body snapped in the dragon's grip... 

... and the dragon's head lolled from the neck 
like a felled tree, then collapsed to the ground, 
raising a cloud of sand across the Storm-Barrows.

A dragon's death matched with the deaths of four
Watchknights. What can be said of such a valiant battle,
only Lord Maluradek knows. He returned many hours
after the field had fallen silent, but not a tear was
shed for his fallen guards—his eyes swam only with
gold and glory.

"The past is dust," was his eulogy to the corpses of
the Watchknights, "the road ahead is a golden one."~

...the battle against Aehirglass grew long, 
and the sky turned bloody in the twilight as 
the Watchknights fought on. Perhaps one 
extra blade would have saved their lives,
but Lord Maluradek was not to be seen. 

Watchknight Zierkki was quick to dash in, 
strike a blow with his spear, then retreat, 
forcing the dragon to turn and attack, 
exposing his flank for the other knights. Even
near exhaustion, Zierkki fought on, fighting
against time itself.

Yet even against such a foe, he persevered.
No strength was wasted, not a drop of blood
shed without purpose, as the knight fought
on, from high sun to lingering twilight,
wearing out the dragon's strength, 
exhausting it while hoarding his own for 
one final strike against the beast...~

...and it was then, Aehirglass rose from its desert berth, 
sand cresting around the azure wyrm like a storm, 
its wings beating like the sails of a mighty sea vessel,
scouring the dust bowl with thousands of teeth, 
each a grain of sand, swift and deadly. 

The fear that had gripped Lord Maluradek 
fell upon our hearts as well, with such weight
we wished to turn our horses and flee with our Lord
to the East, to seek safety within the castle walls.

But then came the crashing of the bravest of
the Watchknights, Geddian, his great sword 
ringing against his shield. The sound gave us
pause and drowned out the roaring of the 
dragon and the wind. The clashing of metal
beat a hymn to Helm, and courage filled our hearts.

"To me, my brothers," he cried. "Steel your 
hearts and raise your weapons! This beast 
shall not take us—our lives for our Lord!"

And thus, bolstered by Geddian's sword-drum, 
we held fast as the beast looped into the sky,
circling our band. Fear rained from its body
yet fell harmlessly upon us like drops of water...~
@27466 = ~While the front and back of this heavy-bound book is of a tarnished bronze, its spine is nothing more than rotting cords of hemp strung through the covers and thick pages within. Despite the tarnished surface and the drapery of cobwebs covering this manuscript, the writing within appears to have survived time's passage without fading. 

"My audience with Lord Maluradek went poorly. No sooner had I voiced my request than the Lord flew into a rage. He threatened to lock me in the dungeon with the treacherous bard should I broach the subject of unsealing the crypts again. I returned to the chapel shaken, and my eyes fell upon the symbol of Helm upon the tablet. I fear I have failed my god by not protecting the Watchknights' reputations.

"My Lord's anger at my request has no foundation that I can see, and I find I am now suspicious about what transpired in his battle against the blue dragon at the Storm-Barrows. The four Watchknights who died aiding their lord against such a beast should be accorded honors, not secreted away like skeletons of ill-omen. A castle built upon such crumbling foundations cannot hold.

"I must make amends, do honor to the fallen Watchknights, but I fear to do so without angering his lordship. He of the Unsleeping Eye, the Vigilant One, My Lord and God Helm is the champion of all guardians—yet which do I guard: the reputation of those brave Watchknights that gave their spirits in Helm's service, or the interests of my Lord?

"And of the bard in the dungeons; what crime did he commit that angered... nay, terrified... my Lord so? The Lord has gone so far as to issue a decree that the bard's name shall not be spoken or transcribed. Even hinting at the minstrel's presence in the dungeon is now just cause for Maluradek to punish the transgressor, as one of the poor guards learned a fortnight ago. It seems as if the Lord wishes to erase the bard from history itself. What is it he fears so?

"What tales might the Watchknights tell had they lived?"

* * *

"A plan of action has been discussed with the Adepts at the chapel, and our hearts are in agreement; we shall construct a hidden vault to honor the knights. We shall conceal our efforts from Maluradek, and guard the vault with six keys fashioned from our ceremonial breastplates. We melted each piece of armor down to forge the sextet of keys: copper, bronze, electrum, silver, gold, and platinum. With these keys, we shall be able to enter the Watchknights' crypts and pay our respects while obeying Lord Maluradek's order that the crypt itself remained sealed. 

"Yet my heart is not eased by this act; adhering to the word and not the spirit of my Lord only drags my own cowardice into the light. Yet I can find no true path between Maluradek's wishes and defending the reputation of the Watchknights. I feel as if my spirit is splayed upon a forked road, and I fear the branching shall tear me in two."

* * *

"I heard the bard's song again today from the dungeons. He sang, his voice strong and proud, through the hours of the high sun, through the twilight, and deep into the night before the Lord finally gathered his royal guards and unlocked the dungeons. Not long after their descent below the castle, the singing was silenced, and many of the guards looked pale when they emerged from the dungeon. Lord Maluradek held a bloody dagger in his hands, and his countenance was that of one near the brink of madness. 

"I should have taken action when I saw the Lord and his guards make their way into the dungeons. Now another corpse lies with the four Watchknights."

* * *

"A terror haunts the night. Strange sounds, ghostly shapes, and echoes of the bard's song have been heard throughout the castle. Whatever transpired in the dungeon between the bard and Maluradek has damned this castle and all its inhabitants. The Lord has sealed himself within his chambers, and many of his servants and guards have either left the castle or have vanished.

"I have nowhere to go, so I have stayed. A great weight hangs on my heart, for Helm made his displeasure known to me. As I stood before the offering bowl that holds the symbol of Helm and recited the evening prayers, the waters of the bowl turned dark and cloudy. I placed my hand in the waters to retrieve the symbol, but my hands found nothing. The symbol was gone.

"I felt a spear enter my heart at this; the Vigilant One has seen my cowardice. He has judged me. I am condemned, unworthy to serve as High Watcher—unworthy to live.

"I have made sure that the doors to the chapel are unlocked. Whatever darkness now haunts the night, I await its judgment.

@27467 = ~This red-stained journal looks to have once been professionally bound, but the texture of its sodden pages suggest it was recently dropped in wine or blood and has yet to dry. It is repellent to the touch, and the pages peel back from each other only reluctantly to reveal the scrawled words penned within.

We ride on the morrow for the Storm-Barrows—I, the four Watchknights of Helm, and a bard to tell the tale of our journey. A glorious adventure awaits—and my thoughts race at the treasure to be gained! I am told the beast has laired in the Storm-Barrows for many summers. No doubt that it has amassed quite a horde within its sinkhole! It is fitting that the death of the beast shall fill my coffers and elevate me in the eyes of the commonfolk. No more sullen glances, no more questioning the royal decrees, no more complaints of taxes, and policies, and border skirmishes... my deeds in the days ahead shall carve a new image of me in the eyes of my people, and the words of Lord Maluradek, Slayer of the Storm-Barrows Dragon, shall be as gold!

* * *

Word of my return spread quickly, and a hero's welcome awaited me as I rode through the gates of the castle. With the head of the dragon raised high in my hands, the crowd of peasants fell to their knees in awe. Without delay, I demanded a feast prepared to honor my victory—and to the bard, the chronicler of my journey, I gave the task of writing the tale of my victory over the wyrm. I told him to make haste with his words, for I wished the tale to be ready in time for the feast. 

There was some talk among the peasants and the Acolytes of Helm about what had happened to the dead Watchknights (at the bard's urging, we had carried their bodies back with us, though it slowed us for many leagues), and to prevent casting a pall over the coming celebration, I ordered the Watchknights' bodies be sealed within the crypts. I spoke of their bravery against the dragon in touching words, and everyone appeared moved by their courage. 

I fear unless the Watchknights are interred soon, however, the many wounds upon their bodies will raise questions as to how I emerged from the battle unscathed. It is best not to dwell upon it—as I told the bard, the past is dust. The road ahead is a golden one!

* * *

The accursed bard has betrayed me! His words have cut deeper than any blade. How dare he spout such filth... such lies?! His curdled words of the battle in the Storm-Barrows were treasonous, lifting up the efforts of the Watchknights above my own bravery, and cursing me for displaying cowardice in battle. I! His Lord! 

Oh, but his barbs were subtle. Did he think I could not see his contempt? That I could not hear his lies? I ordered the guards to seize him before he could complete the tale, and tore the foul poem from his grasp. I ordered him taken to the dungeon—I shall see him rot in chains before he ever sees the sun's rays again! 

As he was being dragged from the hall, I ordered the guards to take his hands as punishment. A... harsh lesson, yes, but one cannot permit treachery to abide within his castle, or else he puts all his dominion at risk.

It was only when I burned the venomous pages of the poem that night, I found some of the pages were missing! This concerns me deeply— if they were to fall into the hands of another... but, no, I must not think of it. The tale is ended, the matter of the bard's fate closed.

* * *

The High Watcher of Helm came to see me at noonday, and feigning deference, he demanded I unseal the Watchknights' crypt so that "the dead may be honored." I cast him from the hall—since when are the actions of a hero questioned in his own throne room?! What deed has that priestly fool ever done in the name of his unblinking god that merits even a footnote in history? I will see him on the rack if he dares question my decrees again!

Yet... even though he has said he will do as I ask, I do not trust him; the Watchknights were of Helm, and the Watcher's sympathies lie with them, not I. I shall watch him... I MUST watch him closely. Should he move to betray me, I shall see him rotting with the bard below. 

* * *

One of the guards dared to speak the name of the bard today, and it was like a fresh wound upon my spirit. I ordered the slack-tongued fool lashed to the gallows pole, his mouth choked with peppered rags, and forbid anyone from speaking or mentioning the bard from this day forward. I will crush the bard's name to dust, bury the ashes, and see that he and his filthy words are forgotten by all! A worthy fate for a venom-tongued creature such as he! 

I have taken the only key to the dungeons for myself. I shall keep it close to me even as I sleep. None shall see the bard, none shall feed him, and he shall eventually starve and die! Choke on your own words, traitor, and justice shall be served!

* * *

He sings! The damnable bard sings, and his song seeks me out even through the walls of my chambers! I cannot sleep. It is so loud that I fear none in the castle can help but hear it! Torture me no more, villain, or I shall see you hanged!

* * *

I could bear no more of his singing—the bard is dead. I severed his poisoned tongue, and left as the life rushed out of his body. My guards... they... they are silent now, and they are afraid of me. Good! Let them fear! Let them show respect—they know their lord is not of small courage now!

* * *

The bard lives... yet he does not! His ghost comes to my chamber, singing, taunting me with the tale of my cowardice at the Storm-Barrows! He calls me "hero," but the word sinks into my breast like an arrow. My servants, my guards—they are gone... yet this beast remains to torture me! Silence and peace—I long for both—silence, spirit, be silent, be SILENT!

* * *

I fear I can bear no more; I cannot trust my eyes or my ears. Again today, the urge to put an end to my torment threatens to drown me. What am I to do? I have seen the ghostly hangman's noose swinging within the tower, with a silhouette that looks too much like my own. I fear it is my future hanging from the rafters of the tower. Do I embrace it? No, I must not! There must be some other way! Yet there is no escape from the castle—all corridors bend back to the tower. Is there no release from this hell but death?

* * *

The end nears. The bard's spirit comes again tonight, and I cannot bear his voice again. I go to the tower now, and I shall meet my future with eyes open. I shall deny him the pleasure of killing me himself! He shall be left alone with his words in this foul castle for all eternity! We shall see if he can abide the silence of these halls—at least there shall be small comfort in that none shall hear the tale of Maluradek again. 

From obscurity I have come, to obscurity I shall go.

@27505 = ~Your wishes are no concern of ours. You shall be dead soon anyway.~
@27506 = ~What do you know of this Luremaster?~
@27507 = ~You mean to tell me this castle is ruled by a ghost?~
@27508 = ~What about the wyverns? Surely they don't recognize your claim to the title of "Queen of the Skies."~
@27509 = ~I'm afraid your reign has come to an end... your highness.~
@27510 = ~What does he want?~
@27511 = ~Enough of your threats, vulture. Let us see if you fight as well as you speak.~
@27512 = ~You're right. We'll worry about the ghost later. Right now I'm more interested in finding out if harpies taste like chicken.~
@27513 = ~Who is this spirit?~
@27514 = ~Exactly how many creatures does this ghost command?~

@27522 = ~Excellent! You have earned your reward.~
@27523 = ~Strength of arms is a virtue shared by all true heroes. For combat is the crucible from which heroic deeds are forged. It is time to test *your* mettle.~

My touch can feel either hot or cold,
Yet I am not meant for a man to hold.~

@27545 = ~Ah, there you are. I'm so glad to see you. I was beginning to think that something terrible happened to you.~
@27546 = ~How did I get in? That's easy. I came in through the secret entrance.~
@27547 = ~Well, if I told you, it wouldn't be a secret anymore, now would it? But forget about such trivial details. What's important now is the task at hand.~
@27548 = ~Exactly. And I think I know where the answer lies.~
@27549 = ~First, you must do something for me. I've been looking for a key that is hidden somewhere inside this keep. I believe it must be upstairs, possibly within the bedchambers of the late lord himself.~
@27550 = ~Look, I don't have time for your ridiculous questions. I *need* this key. I *must* have it. Now are you going to get it for me or not?~
@27551 = ~*growl* I knew this was a waste of time! Fine! We *will* find the key. And if you won't help us... you will die!~
@27552 = ~Of course I am. We're old friends, aren't we? However, now is not the time for catching up. What's important now is the task at hand.~
@27553 = ~Wait! Do not go just yet. I know how we can escape from this place. I can lead you out.~
@27554 = ~Looking for a way out, just like you. And I think I may have found it.~
@27555 = ~Of course I care. That's why I came in here... to find a means to escape this evil place.~
@27556 = ~How did you get inside the keep?~
@27557 = ~You're *glad* to see us?~
@27558 = ~What are you doing here?~
@27559 = ~What secret entrance?~
@27560 = ~You little sneak. Why didn't you tell us there was a secret way into the keep?~
@27561 = ~You mean solving the Luremaster's second riddle.~
@27562 = ~You're right... we'd better get to it. Farewell, Hobart.~
@27563 = ~Really? Tell us.~
@27564 = ~Why are you suddenly being so helpful? A while ago, you couldn't care less if we lived or died.~
@27565 = ~Why should we help you? You certainly haven't shown much interest in helping us.~
@27566 = ~Why is this key so important to you?~
@27567 = ~I don't understand. If you know where it is, why don't you get it yourself?~
@27568 = ~No, we're not. Find it yourself.~
@27569 = ~We're not going anywhere until you give us some answers.~

@27605 = ~Your perseverance and strength of arms has allowed you to prevail where others found only death and defeat. You are a shining light in a dark and frightening world filled with terrible beasts and faceless evils.~
@27606 = ~It is the deeds such as yours—the deeds of heroes—that shall inspire the hearts and minds of generations to come. Take care that your deeds are not forgotten. For it is the doom of man that he forgets.~
