## Overview

This mod makes the Icewind Dale expansion "Trials of the Luremaster" available to BG2:EE (2.0 or higher) and EET (Enhanced Edition Trilogy).

The quest starts by talking to the halfling Hobart Stubbletoes, who can be found in the Umar Hills Inn. In the course of the adventure you have the opportunity to explore a haunted castle, test your mettle in challenging combat and lift an ancient curse.


## Components

### 1. Trials of the Luremaster *(requires BG2:EE or EET patched to 2.0 or higher)*

This is the main component. It installs many new areas, creatures, items, spells and everything else needed to enjoy the adventure.

The mod makes a number of slight changes to the adventure to bring it more in line with BG2. Spells and items that are only available in Icewind Dale and have little or no relevance in the adventure have been replaced by similar BG2 spells or items. Moreover, several events, scripts and creature animations have been expanded, improved or adapted to BG2 style.

### 2. Make IWD spells available to the player *(requires the main component)*

The mod installs a number of unique Icewind Dale spells, which are used by the various creatures in the course of the adventure. This component makes these spells available to the player and adds them to a number of stores, creatures and containers. The component is superseded by similar components from IWDification or Sword Coast Stratagems (SCS).

### 3. Rebalance weapons and equipment *(requires the main component)*

Many items in Icewind Dale are more powerful than items found in Baldur's Gate II. Since the mod allows you to gain access to several powerful weapons, armor and equipment, it may diminish the challenge from the rest of the game. This component replaces these items by less powerful variants.
