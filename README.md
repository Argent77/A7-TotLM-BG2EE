## Overview

This mod makes the Icewind Dale expansion "Trials of the Luremaster" available to BG2:EE (2.0 or higher), Siege of Dragonspear and EET (Enhanced Edition Trilogy).

The quest starts by talking to the halfling Hobart Stubbletoes, who can be found either in the Umar Hills Inn (SoA), Amkethran Inn (ToB) or in the southeastern area of the Coalition Camp (SoD). In the course of the adventure you have the opportunity to explore a haunted castle, test your mettle in challenging combat and lift an ancient curse.


## Components

### 1. Trials of the Luremaster *(requires BG2:EE or EET patched to 2.0 or higher)*

This is the main component. It installs many new areas, creatures, items, spells and everything else needed to enjoy the adventure.

The mod makes a number of slight changes to the adventure to bring it more in line with BG2. Spells and items that are only available in Icewind Dale and have little or no relevance in the adventure have been replaced by similar BG2 spells or items. Moreover, several events, scripts and creature animations have been expanded, improved or adapted to BG2 style.

This component also makes a good number of unique Icewind Dale spells available to the player. They are added to various stores, creatures and containers.

### 2. Rebalance weapons and equipment *(requires the main component; not available for SoD)*

Many items in Icewind Dale are more powerful than items found in Baldur's Gate II. Since the mod allows you to gain access to several powerful weapons, armor and equipment, it may diminish the challenge from the rest of the game. This component replaces these items by less powerful variants.

### 3. Reduce experience from monsters and quests *(requires the main component)*

The whole adventure allows you to earn about 300,000 to 400,000 XP which can be too much depending on when or where you start the quest. This component allows you to reduce the experience gained from killing monsters or granted by completing quest stages. You can choose from the following options:

1. Reduce by 25 percent
2. Reduce by 50 percent
3. Reduce by 75 percent *(Recommended if you start the quest in the Coalition Camp, Siege of Dragonspear campaign.)*
4. Grant no experience
